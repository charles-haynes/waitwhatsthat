We’re a couple in our 50s who’ve given up a fixed address and our
"things" and are travelling the world. We started by each picking
three places we’d never been and are spending a year visiting
them. Debbie’s three are Jordan, Iceland, and Peru. Charles’s are
Vanuatu, Morocco, and Peru.

We've made a few stopovers and detours to meet people on the way. We
travel with one bag and one carryon each (total 20kg each) and that’s
everything we own. We like people, food, and photography.
