### The place

El Mercado is a fancy fish oriented restaurant by Rafael Osterling
(the chef/owner of [Rafael.](https://waitwhatsthat.com/rafael/)) It
has a reputation as the best cevicheria in Lima and it regularly makes
the lists of the best restaurants in Peru. Sounded like our kind of
place.

I don't know if it's called "El Mercado" because it has the ambience
of a market, or because it's across the street from the Miraflores
mercado, but either way it's a breezy open space, green and
relaxing. The space itself feels very much like you're in an
indoor/outdoor patio set in a tropical forest. An amazing
accomplishment given that it's actually set in a rather ordinary
neighborhood of concrete high rise apartments and small mechanic's
shops.

### Ceviche

The ceviche may be the best we've had. We had both a ceviche
"Pucusana" and a tiradito "Nikkei." Pucusana is a fishing village
south of Lima, we plan to stop there on our way south, and the
Pucusana ceviche had _pejerrey_ (Argentine Silverside), _erizo_ (sea
urchin - uni), and _conchita_ (scallops) in a mild sauce and including
ripe avocado. The pejerrey is a mild silvery fish and the light
ceviche was perfect for it. Anything stronger would have overpowered
it. We love erizo and order it every chance we get, but it's similarly
delicate. The avocado nicely rounded out the flavors with the sweet
scallops. All together it was well balanced, and the subtle flavors
were a reminder that ceviche does not have to hit you on the head.

### Tiradito

Tiradito is based on sashimi. The fish is sliced into thin rectangular
slices rather than cubes, is not "cooked" in an acidic marinade, and
doesn't have onions. Instead the sauce is poured over just before
serving.

I didn't realize that Nobu Matsuhisa (_that_ Nobu) first went to Peru
after leaving Japan 45 years ago. While here, the story goes, he
invented _tiradito_ when a guest asked for ceviche without onions. So
all tiradito is in some sense "_nikkei._" The "nikkei" tiradito at El
Mercado was yellowfin tuna with a mild sweet soy and sesame oil sauce
garnished with an avocado fan. Not flashy, just delicious.

### Empanadas

_Empanadas Porteñas_ ("port" empanadas) are presumably called that
because they're filled with shrimp and squid rather than the
traditional beef. These should probably be called _empanaditos_
because they're small and cute. Lima loves its empanadas, every street
vendor and food stall will sell you an empanada of chicken or meat of
uncertain provenance, but these seafood empanadas were just fine.

### Scallops

While we had quickly decided on ceviche and tiradito, I strained my
limited Spanish and asked our waiter for a recommendation for a third
dish. He suggested grilled _conchas_ (scallops). I had earlier seen
the impressive wood fired grill so we were set. We had a combo of
three style _griego_ ("greek") with pisco butter, yellow _ají_ pepper,
and oregano; "reggiana" with brown butter, parmesan, and garlic; and
"aztec" with jalapeño butter and mezcal. The scallops were perfectly
grilled, still juicy and tender with the roe still soft but with nice
browned grill flavors. The flavors of the scallops dominated, with the
sauces providing just an accent. There was a bit of menu writing
license, I'm pretty sure greeks don't use ají amarillo sauce on
scallops.

### Dessert

We hadn't yet tried the classic _Limeña suspira_ (Lima sigh) so we had
it "three ways" for dessert. Classic _manjar blanco_ (aka _dulce de
leche_), lucuma, and chirimoya. The name "manjar blanco" comes from
blancmange, but in reality is a hundred times better. It's milk and
sugar cooked down until it becomes thick and brown and caramelly. It's
called dulce de leche in other parts of South America and in
Mexico. For limeña suspira it has added egg yolk and vanilla to make a
pudding, and is topped with a soft sticky meringue. A lucuma version
makes sense. Lucuma, Peru's favorite dessert fruit, tastes of rich
butterscotch, maple, and sweet potato. The chirimoya version adds a
bit of contrast with fruity strawberry, banana, and pear notes. The
meringue was not my favorite, it reminds me of marshmallow fluff, but
I'm not going to argue with a 100 year old tradition.

### In conclusion

Great fresh fish treated with respect, airy green outdoorsy space,
upscale but not fussy or pretentious.
