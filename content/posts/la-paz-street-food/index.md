Our friend Elisa, who we met in Lima, introduced us to her friend
Coral who does street food tours in La Paz! So we went out last night
and even though it was a bit cold and a bit rainy we had a great
time. She came by in her car, with her son to translate, and took us
to a half dozen street food places. It was interesting that all of the
shops and stands are run by women.

### Chola Sandwich

{{< img "images/La-Paz-Pork-Leg.jpg" "300x225" "Pork Leg" >}}
First stop was a roast pork sandwich place run by two sisters and
billed as _"El Mejor Sándwich De Chola De La Paz "Doña Paula"_ (The
best Chola Sandwich in La Paz "Doña Paula") This same stand has been
in operation for 53 years, and they only serve one thing. A roast pork
leg sandwich called a _sándwich de la chola_. Cholas are native Aymara
or Quechua women who wear distinctive dresses, petticoats, and
hats. Anyway these sandwiches are slices of roast pork leg, crispy
skin, onion and carrot escabeche, and a handmade _salsa ají_. These
sandwiches are so delicious! They go through about ten roast pork legs
a day, starting around 4pm and finishing when the pork runs out -
usually 8 or 9pm.

### Sausage Sandwich

Next up was _Doña Elvira's Sándwich de Chorizo_ that is a handmade
sausage of four meats (beef, pork, alpaca, and I'm not sure what),
served on a fresh bun. Sadly we arrived as they were cleaning up, but
we've got the location, and we'll be back. I'll update this when we
do.

Today we went back. It's a tiny little shop located in the
_Mercado Lanza_ just north of _Plaza San Francisco_. There's a bench
along one wall with a half dozen seats, and a dozen or so more seats
around it outside. It's super popular with people standing around
eating their sandwiches. The one thing they serve is a _chorizo_
(sausage) sandwich. You have a choice of two kinds of bread, a choice
of garnishes (_escabeche_, lettuce, vegetables), and a choice of
sauces (mayonnaise and/or mustard).

### Braised Tripe

_Tripa_ is beef tripe cooked in a giant enameled metal pan over a gas
fire. It ends up partially fried and partially braised and entirely
delicious. Succulent savoury umami juices coating slippery chewy meaty
tripe with slices of potatoes. It's served on little plastic plates
covered with tiny plastic bags while you sit around the cart on
plastic stools. This is a quintessential "after the clubs" dish to
soak up excess alcohol. We like it even without the alcohol.

### Beef Heart

{{< img "images/La-Paz-Anticuchos-stand.jpg" "271x300" "Anticuchos stand" >}}

Bolivian _anticuchos_ (grilled beef heart) are smaller and thinner
than Peruvian _anticuchos._ The most famous place to get _anticuchos_
in La Paz is at _mercado "Las Velas."_ We visited, but our host had a
bad experience with a mouse here so she wouldn't let us eat
anything. However Las Velas was already on my list of place to visit
so I'll be back. There's another excellent _anticuchos_ cart right up
the street from where we're staying, but by the time we got there we
were so full we couldn't eat anything more, so that's also on the list
for a return visit.

Apparently the anticuchos cart near where we're staying is quite
famous! Whenever I mentioned _"anticuchos"_ and _"Sopocachi"_ (our
neighborhood) people all said to visit this cart. So we did. It's a
wood fired grill with a big flaming oil lamp on it. You can get one
skewer (_simple_) or two (_doble_) with potatoes and optionally spicy
peanut sauce (_mani_). It's 9 bs for a _doble_ served in a plastic
tray with a toothpick.

The anticuchos are, unsurprisingly, delicious. While thinner than
Peruvian anticuchos they were flavorful and tender and the potatoes
and sauce made a nice accompaniment. Two skewers were enough for us
for dinner, but we weren't that hungry.

The cart has flattened boxes spread around it to protect the sidewalk
from drips by the crowd surrounding the cart. The are dramatic flaming
flare-ups every time new skewers are added or turned, which is a lot
of fun.

### Braised Kidneys

_Riñoncitos al jugo_ or braised kidneys are another classic late night
after club snack. During an earlier discussion of _anticuchos_ we had
asked about other kinds of offal. Once Coral knew we liked organ meats
she lit up and we got to visit all the less well known street food
carts serving offal. This one, like most stands, serves just one
dish - braised kidneys in their own juice (no not that juice.) The
kidneys were well prepared, clean and not overcooked. They were served
with a deep fried egg, shredded carrot, and an optional spicy salsa.

### _Api_ and _Pastel_

{{< img "images/La-Paz-Api-2.jpg" "225x300" "Api" >}}

We were near the traditional Christmas Fair fairgrounds, where they
sell _api y pastel._ _Api_ is a traditional drink of the Bolivian
Andes, it's made with purple corn, sugar, cinnamon and cloves. It
reminds me a little of the Peruvian _chicha morada_ except that it's
much thicker and served warm. There are two versions purple and white
depending on which corn you use to make it. It's traditionally served
with _pastel_ which is a thin light crispy cheese empanada. The stands
also sell another warm sweet corn drink _tojori_ that I want to
try. Apparently one of the best carts for _api_ is right near where
we're staying so we'll have to give them a visit.

### Salteñas

{{< img "images/La-Paz-Salteñas-4.jpg" "300x180" "Salteñas" >}}

Besides the places we visited on our tour, we see lots of people
selling _sateñas_ on the street, and lots of __salteña___rías_ in the
neighborhood. A _salteña_ is a small meat filled pastry, similar to an
_empanada_. The filling can be nearly anything, chicken, beef, pork,
cheese, spicy, or not spicy. They're usually quite juicy, and are
baked in a very hot oven which gives them their characteristic dark
brown ridge on the top. If we were staying in La Paz longer I might
try getting everyone's recommendation for the best _salteñería_ and
trying them all, but as it is we've tried a few in the
neighborhood. They make a nice comforting warm snack but the sauce
tends to be a bit sweet for my taste.

### Ceviche

We tried one _ceviche_ cart while we were out walking around. It was
pretty good! It had all the usual ingredients, fish, seafood, _choclo_
(giant corn), _cancha_ (parched corn), and _camote_ (sweet potato.)
Wasn't earth shattering but it was tasty and we didn't suffer any ill
effects from eating "raw" fish on the street.
