If you're looking for great bread in Lima, bingo! this is the
place. Crusty chewy super-hydrated breads are the reason to come
here. The bread then gets used to make their sandwiches, elevating the
humble _mixto_ to something extraordinary. The space is bright, open,
with wood everywhere. A place you could sit and spend hours relaxing
and enjoying the food and a book. Sadly the coffee, while perfectly
adequate, can't match the excellence of the bread.

Everything is served on wooden cutting boards, they have a fresh juice
menu with things like spinach, apple, and ginger; and carrot and
orange. There's a nice selection of pastries. We try not to be the
kind of people who say "this place is nice, but it's not Tartine" or
"why can't we find a nice brunch place like in Melbourne" but this
place does remind me of a brunch place in Melbourne right down to the
avocado and hummus sandwiches. The bread and the morning bun does
remind me of Tartine, and it was lovely. El Pan de la Chola has good
sourdough croissants and pain au chocolate (though not up to the level
of a croissant obsessive like Lune in Melbourne), and big oatmeal
chocolate chip cookies.

This has become our new favorite weekend brunch places. There are
families, couples, backpackers, businesspeople, tourists and
locals. It will be one of the first places we go any time we come back
to Lima. Did I mention they have amazing bread?
