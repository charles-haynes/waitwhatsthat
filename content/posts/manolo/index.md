Manolo is an old fashioned Lima _caféteria_ (coffee shop)
and _churreria_ in the heart of Miraflores.  It's an institution,
founded in 1968 and is a comforting favorite of families of all
ages. You see grandparents who may have met there, and new families
bringing their kids. There's a huge menu of sandwiches, pastas,
seafood, and desserts

The portions are big, the _crema volteada_ ("turned over" cream, like
a flan) nearly covered the plate. The meals are family sized because
this is a family place. While there are tourists here, there are
plenty of ordinary people enjoying an old favorite as well.

But really there's one big reason to come to Manolo: the churros. You
have two varieties, filled (_relleno_) or unfilled, and three flavours
of filled, chocolate, vanilla, or _dulce de leche_. Six plain churros
or one filled churro for 6 soles. Less than 2 US dollars.
