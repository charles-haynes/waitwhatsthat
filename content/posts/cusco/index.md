## Cusco

{{< img "images/Moray-MIL-MIL.jpg" "300x266" "MIL" >}}
Cusco is a beautiful World Heritage city. We decided we’d spend some
time here on our way from Lima to La Paz. Besides being the gateway to
Machu Picchu, it’s the former capital of the Inca empire and arguably
the cultural capital of Peru. We stayed for nearly a week not doing
much because it’s also at 3400 meters above sea level (over 11,000
feet) and it’s quite hilly. We visited the pre-columbian art museum
(artifacts from Larco Museum in Lima) and the natural history museum.

We also knew that Virgilio Martínez had a restaurant in Cusco called
MIL, and we knew we wanted to go _there_. What we didn’t know was that
it’s actually in Moray, which is 90 minutes from Cusco in the Sacred
Valley. So we hired a driver to take us there and back and, like we do
when we fly, we asked if there were any interesting places on the
way. Turns out there was!

## Maras

### Salt Ponds

{{< img "images/Maras-Salt-Ponds-Salt-Terraces.jpg" "300x112" "Salt Terraces" >}}
The Maras salt ponds are a pre-Inca salt mine that is still in use
today. You come around a corner on the road and are faced with a
hillside covered in white terraces. The terrace complex is fed by an
underground stream that is channeled into a series of communally
managed shallow ponds where the sun evaporates the brine. Anyone in
the community can have a pond, everyone maintains the infrastructure
of channels, paths, and terraces together. Newcomers get the less
desirable locations further away from the village. After the salt is
dried and harvested it’s sold all over Peru. I broke my rule about
getting more “stuff” and acquired a small bag of the salt. We’ll see
if it survives the next time I have to reduce the weight of my
luggage.

## Moray

### Terraces

{{< img "images/Moray-Moray-terraces.jpg" "300x277" "Moray terraces" >}}
After visiting the salt mines, we drove a short distance to
Moray. Moray is a visually striking set of Inca ruins, consisting of
concentric circular terraces about 30m deep. Their purpose is still
not known, but the temperature difference from the bottom to the top
is about 15ºC total. One possible explanation is that it was an
agricultural research center exploring suitability of crops for
different climate zones.

## MIL

MIL is Virgilio Martínez’s Cusco restaurant. Either because it’s the
low season, or because it’s not as centrally located, it was easy to
get a table. We chose lunch, because it’s often more relaxed, you
don’t go to bed uncomfortably full, and the light is better for
photos. The complex is beautifully suited to the site, elegantly and
simply blending with the terrain and landscape.

{{< img "images/Moray-MIL-Experimental-plants.jpg" "300x224" "Experimental plants" >}}
When we arrived we were given a tour of the grounds and the other
things going on on site. Besides the restaurant and garden, there is a
research arm in to local Peruvian ingredients and experiments in how
to use them. There’s also an anthropological component, working with
local people to learn more about how these foods are used
traditionally, not just in consumption but the role they play in
society. It reminded me of Orana or Attica in Australia, or Hiakai in
New Zealand.

As part of the tour they explained how they were exploring the
different local varieties of Cacao, and there were two small electric
stone mills grinding their own chocolate. I now want a stone mill,
except that I think they probably weigh 20kg just by themselves.

There’s also an area for fermentations including a kombucha made from
local tea and panela, and an alembic still and alcoholic herbal
infusions.

After the site tour we were seated in the restaurant. Similarly to
[Central](/central/) the menu is organized by
geography, primarily by elevation, and beyond dietary restrictions
there aren’t any choices. We also chose to have the non-alcoholic
beverage pairings.

### Preservation

#### Freeze dried potato (chuño), corn, wild uchucate, oca

{{< img "images/Moray-MIL-Chuñyo.jpg" "300x130" "Chuñyo" >}}
Chuño is naturally freeze dried potato, a technique invented centuries
ago. There are two varieties: White and Black. White is supposed to be
easy to digest, but I haven’t noticed any difficulty with either of
them. These were ground and made into crisps, kind of like pringles
which should be no surprise as pringles are made from dried
potatoes. There was a berry butter yum), and a rocoto, huacatay, and
tree tomato (tamarillo) salsa. There was a coca leaf bread with oca
which was a lot like a soft bread stuffed with potato, finally singed
corn cakes that were a little gummy but full of corn flavor.

### Plateau

#### Cabuya nectar, lamb, kaniwa grain, white quinoa

{{< img "images/Moray-MIL-Lamb-tartare.jpg" "292x300" "Lamb tartare" >}}
The lamb tartare with cherimoya dressing was a great combination,
fruity and umami. The kaniwa crisps made the right texture contrast
and the a creamy white quinoa dip went well with both. A bowl of fresh
garden greens was simple and refreshing in the middle of food that was
otherwise about process. A small cup of tumbo and cabuya nectar on the
side added needed tartness.

### Andean Forest

#### Lupinus legume, pork belly, avocado, rocoto pepper

{{< img "images/Moray-MIL-Lupinus-bread.jpg" "300x281" "Lupinus bread" >}}
Lupines are peas, and grow wild all over the world, including Peru. So
this course was a sprouted pea bread, and peas in the pork belly
confit. I thought this dish might have needed more work. The flavours
were great but the textures weren’t quite there yet. The rocoto and
avocado salsa on the other hand was really great.

### Diversity of Corn

#### Piscaronto, chullupi, white corn, local cheese

This was some very light corn crisps, a bright green chullupi puree,
big kernels of choclo, and toasted fresh cheese. You combine all of
the ingredients in the bowl and try to get some of all of them in each
bite. The sweetness of the corn, the herbaceous chullupi, the nuggets
of choclo all worked well together, I liked the dairy flavors of the
local fresh cheese, but Debbie was not as fond of the cheese as I was.

### Extreme Altitude

#### Duck, black quinoa, lake blue-green algae, wheat

We can confirm that ducks and blue-green algae do live at extreme
altitude, having seen them on our trip to Colca Canyon. This dish also
included crispy kale leaves and a puree with edible flowers.

### Central Andes

#### Potatoes, stems, chaco clay, chincho

{{< img "images/Moray-MIL-Potatoes.jpg" "300x217" "Potatoes" >}}
This dish connected to the local people and their harvest between June
and July. Freshly harvested potatoes are roasted in a traditional oven
and eaten communally with your fingers, dipped in sauce. One table
nearby asked for a knife and fork which I found slightly
disappointing. It was fun to share the potatoes and eat them with your
fingers.

### Frozen Cordillera

#### Wild muña, tumbo, kjolle

This was more of a palate cleanser than a dessert. Tart tumbo granita
with fresh wild muña leaves and a pink potato puree colored with
kjolle flower. [Kjolle](/kjolle/) is also the
name of Pia León's restaurant in Lima.

### Huatia of Cacao

#### Mashwa, coca leaf, cacao mucilage

This dessert was coca powder, frozen local cacao mucilage, and frozen
chocolate mousse served with thin purple and yellow mashwa crisps. It
reminded us of one of the desserts we had a Central, but the
ingredients had been prepared differently. We finished with a hot
chocolate, and a V60 coffee made with red bourbon arabica beans by
Three Monkeys.

### Virgilio Martínez

{{< img "images/ORG_DSC02195.jpg" "300x200" "Virgilio Martínez" >}}
We’ve been seeking out Virgilio Martínez’s restaurants in Peru. He’s
most famous for Central in Lima, but MIL is one of his pet projects
and he was on site! He said hi, and graciously agreed to pose for a
picture with us.

## Bottom line

MIL was awesome, everything we expected or wanted. The salt ponds and
Moray are worth a visit. Having a driver was totally worth it.
