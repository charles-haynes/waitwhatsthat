## Nazca

The Nazca “lines” are a group of lines and geoglyphs carved into the
desert plain outside the city of Nazca. They’re about 2000 years old
and were constructed by the Nazca culture (who also made some pretty
awesome ceramics.) Most of them are lines and geometric shapes, but
the most famous and most interesting ones seems to be images of
animals and people. Monkey, condor, whale, person, hummingbird,
parrot, tree, and some harder to interpret. We don’t really know what
their significance is, but current consensus is that they had
religious significance.

There’s a viewing tower by the side of the highway that lets you see
three of the figures, but to really see them you have to fly over
them. We signed up for the flight, and stayed overnight in Nazca city
so we could be on the first flight in the morning. In theory the light
would be better and the air less turbulent early in the day.

The flight was in an eight seater single engine high wing plane. I
don’t know plane models… the takeoff and flight were relatively
uneventful, but the view was as good as we’d hoped! I’ll let the
photos speak for themselves. On final approach for landing we also got
to see some of the Nazca aqueducts. They had a large and sophisticated
underground hydraulic system bringing water to their agricultural
areas over long distances and the surviving structures are
impressive. I’m glad we went early since the tight turns in the small
plane were plenty for my stomach!
