Lima has an active bakery scene both _pastelarias_ or pastry shops, and _panaderías_ which are bread shops. There's a standard repertoire that includes _alfajores de manjar_, a sandwich cookie made from cornstarch and filled with _manjar_ (_dulce de leche_) caramelized sweetened milk.) The cookie came to Peru from Spain, and came to Spain from al-Andalus. The name comes from the arabic الفاخر, _al- fakher_. But I digress. There are also tarts, cakes, and pies. The panaderias generally sell a _francese_ roll which is a simple white bread divided in two, a sweet _pan de yema_ which is a soft egg bread, and various baguettes and loaves. There were a few standouts, and one amazing bakery that I saved for last.

## Panadería Carmelitas

We originally went to this place because a friend, [Max
Veenhuyzen](https://instagram.com/maxveenhuyzen?utm_source=ig_profile_share&igshid=l1u551vhvu4l),
had eaten there and recommended the pork sandwiches (which are
wonderful.) They also have some of the best _francese_ (french) and
_yema_ (egg) rolls we found. Because it was October there was also a
big tray of _turron de doña pepa_ which looked like a cake but was
actually more like a cookie with brown sugar syrup. The sandwiches are
good and the bread is even better. If it had been closer we’d probably
have been regulars.

## Ana Avellana

This is a bakery that is supposedly "the best bakery in Lima." If you
believe online reviews. Which you shouldn’t. Most interesting to us
was that it was supposed to have really good cheesecake. Debbie loves
cheesecake, and their cheesecake _is_ really good. Baked of course
tall and agreeably dense with a good texture and noticeable cheese
flavors. It’s not too sweet and the fresh fruit on it is an excellent
choice. It might well be the best cheesecake in Lima.

The space itself is very light and open. They have a wide selection of
other pastries and cookies though none of them quite live up to the
promise of the cheesecake. Their pecan sticky bun was good, thick and
yeasty and had good pecan flavors. Sadly the coffee is only “okay,”
not great. It feels very warm and welcoming and a lot of the people
there seem like expats or upper upper-middle-class Peruvians. It felt
very comfortable to us expats.

Overall - great cheesecake, good pecan sticky bun, but not "the best
bakery in Lima."

## Maria Amenara

It was nice to find another open, friendly, light, airy cafe. It’s a
nice place to sit and hanging out. They have a dense moist chocolate
turron, almost a brownie in consistency. There’s an impressively
stocked display case, but nothing really stood out as amazing. The
carrot cake was ok, most of the other things looked ok, the coffee was
ok, so we probably won't go back. Worth a visit if you're in the area
or want a place to chill for a couple hours but otherwise not worth a
special trip.

## Cafe y Chocolate

Cafe y chocolate is a cute little coffee shop/pastelaria in Miraflores
near where we were staying. It has a friendly staff, and a small
selection of very well done pastries and cookies. It doesn't try to
compete with the big pastry places, instead concentrating on doing a
few things well. We enjoyed it.

## La Baguette

It's a popular big chain with branches everywhere. It’s a competent
bakery with good prices, nothing super special. A place to pick up
breads and rolls if you don't have anything better nearby. Much better
than the supermarkets.

## Pan de Criolla

Nice but rather ordinary place, the "pig ear" was maybe a little old,
the coffee ordinary. Nice place to sit for a few minutes if you're
nearby but don’t go out of your way.

## La Panetteria Barranco (Laboratorio)

Nice little place in Barranco. Tasty and creative desserts, ordinary
coffee. There’s a nice mezzanine to sit at overlooking the main
floor. I thought their lemon mousse was particularly nice.

## El Pan de la Chola

{{< img src="images/Lima-El-Pan-de-la-Chola-Morning-bun.jpg" fill="950x1024" caption="Morning bun" >}}

This place is so good that I’ve written a [whole
post](/posts/el-pan-de-la-chola/) about it. The
breads are _amazing_, super hydrated, chewy crusty bread that reminds
me of Tartine in San Francisco, or Sonoma Bakery in Sydney. The space
itself is full of wooden tables that encourage you to sit and enjoy
the space. They have cookies and pastries as well, the morning bun is
particularly good, but the bread is so good it will make you forget
the sweets.
