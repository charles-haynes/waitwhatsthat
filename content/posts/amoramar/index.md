### The place

{{< img src="images/Lima-Amoramar-Amaromar.jpg" fill="300x159" caption="Amoramar" >}}
Amoramar is another gem tucked away in an urban environment. On an
otherwise unremarkable back street in Barranco, you go through a door
and into an oasis. A tree lined patio with tables under a screened
roof. You walk past the big wood fired brick oven where the
_parrillero_ is roasting a _cochinillo lechal_ (suckling piglet.)

### The food

The menu is modern Peruvian with sections for _Entradas, Wok, Pesca,
Granja,_ and _"Para Endulzar"_ We decided to have two entrees, a fish,
and a dessert.

They started by bringing us an _abreboca_ (amuse/appetiser) of pork
and plantain crisp with an asian salsa. It was tasty and helped make
up for our decision to not have the roast piglet.

#### Cheese tiradito?!

We had seen _Tiradito Grana Padano_ on the menu and had been bemused
and intrigued. A tiradito of cheese? Probably not. A tiradito _with_
cheese? That almost as strange. How can you pair raw fish with cheese?
Ok, we had to try it. It was a tiradito of seared scallop and white
fish dressed with a _leche de tigre_ ("tiger's milk" juice for
ceviche) emulsion, garnished with radish, avocado  puree, and grana
padano crisps. It actually worked pretty well.

#### Grilled scallops

We tried their _Conchas al Fuego_ (grilled scallops). They were served
in the shell very hot on a bed of rock salt. The seasoning was asian
lemon butter and crispy garlic. It was a bit sweet, nice but not
extraordinary, but grilled scallops are always a treat.

#### Paiche

We've been seeing _paiche_ on menus a lot in Lima. It's the second
largest fresh water fish in the world. Mature paiche can be over 3
metres long, and over 250 kg. Native to the Amazon river they are
under pressure in the wild, but have been successfully farmed in
Brazil. I think of it a little like the barramundi of South America
only a lot bigger. This was grilled paiche over asparagus and potato
puree. The paiche was delicious, firm and tasty, asparagus was fresh,
sweet, and not overcooked.

#### Dessert

Finally we shared a _Isla de Frutos del Bosque_ "Island of fruits of
the forest." Is "fruits of the forest" some sort of code for
strawberries and blueberries? Every time I see "fruits of the forest"
it ends up being strawberries (not from the forest) and blueberries
(also not from the forest.) Besides the fresh fruits the dessert
included chocolate soil, and some sort of sweet brown gelatine and a
sweet strawberry sauce over the top. The strawberries were underripe,
the tan jello was boring, and the strawberry sauce was too
sweet. Amoramar needs to raise their dessert game...

### In Conclusion

Overall the setting was excellent, the dishes were well done but not
particularly innovative. The suckling pig looked great though!
