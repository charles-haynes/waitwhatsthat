## Before you go

{{< img src="images/Machu-Picchu-Machu-Picchu-2.jpg" fill="300x246" caption="Machu Picchu Selfie" >}}
I always thought that Machu Picchu was only for young fit people. That
you had to trek in and walk up a mountain to get there. Not true. Even
old less than fit people can easily visit. You don’t have to sign up
for an expensive tour either, it’s easy to do on your own as an
independent traveller. A cab or Uber from Cusco to Poroy (US$8), a
train from Poroy to Machu Picchu Pueblo (US$70 p/p), a comfortable bus
to the site itself (US$12 p/p), and leisurely walking around the site
(US$50 p/p). All prices are one-way.

Machu Picchu is about the same altitude as Cusco (and Machu Picchu
Pueblo is significantly lower.) We wanted a chance to acclimatize so
we spent a few days beforehand in Cusco. Plus Cusco is also a great
destination in itself. I’m glad we did. I don’t think we would have
enjoyed walking around Machu Picchu nearly as much if we hadn’t taken
that time. You can also take sorojchi which is a painkiller with
caffeine, or coca tea. We did drink coca tea and it helps but we
skipped the sorojchi.

## Getting there

### Cusco to Machu Picchu Pueblo (Aguas Calientes)

{{< img src="images/Poroy-All-Aboard.jpg" fill="300x229" caption="All Aboard" >}}
The easiest and most comfortable way to get from Cusco to Machu Picchu
is to take the train. Unfortunately unless you’re a Cusco resident
(and can prove it) you have to catch the train in Poroy, about 30
minutes from Central Cusco. You can take a cab or we took Uber,
getting to Poroy should cost about s/. 25 one way (about US$8 in
2018.) There are two train operators, PeruRail and IncaRail, with
similar prices, schedules, and equipment. We opted for PeruRail
“Vistadome” (with snacks and soft drinks) on the way out and PeruRail
“Explorer” (no snacks) on the way back. The cost is about US$50-80
each way. You should buy and print your train tickets beforehand
either at home, your hotel, or at PeruRail in Lima or Cusco. They tear
off and keep half of the printed page at the station. Luggage on the
train is limited to a single small bag of no more than 5kg per person
(though they didn’t weigh ours.) It looked to me like some people were
bringing larger bags or even small suitcases, so _maybe_ you can get
away with bringing a carry on sized bag. You can store luggage at
Poroy station for free and we did. The train trip itself is
beautiful. The views are stunning. The route follows the river through
picturesque gorges. You see wildlife, pretty flowers, grazing animals,
ancient farming terraces, Andean towns, and of course stunning
mountains.

### Machu Picchu Pueblo to Machu Picchu

{{< img src="images/Machu-Picchu-Pueblo-Machu-Picchu-Pueblo.jpg" fill="300x217" caption="Machu Picchu Pueblo" >}}
The town of Machu Picchu Pueblo is all about the tourism. That’s not
so surprising, Machu Picchu _is_ the most popular tourist destination
in Peru. The restaurants are pretty much limited to tourist Peruvian,
tourist Hamburger, or tourist Pizza. There are a couple of nicer
restaurants but nothing too special. We picked restaurants for the
views and that worked out for us. There’s supposed to be a hot spring
in town as well, but after reading the reviews we decided to skip it.

We had decided to splurge a little bit and stay at a fancier hotel in
a room with a view of the river. I’m really glad we did. The views
were great, right overlooking the river, the room was big and airy and
the bed was HUGE. It was a nice break from the mid-range three star
hotels we’ve been staying in and the price was quite reasonable
(US$60/night.)

{{< img src="images/Machu-Picchu-The-switchbacks.jpg" fill="300x207" caption="The switchbacks" >}}
To get from town to Machu Picchu itself there is a shared bus (US$12
p/p each way). The stop is just a block or two downhill from the
center of town. It leaves when it’s full which in practice is quite
frequently. The bus goes up some exposed feeling switchbacks and
eventually drops you right at the entrance. You should get your bus
tickets beforehand to save a little time, you’ll need your passport
and cash (our hotel took care of it for us.) The bus just scans the
ticket so you might be able to buy online just on your smartphone but
our hotel gave us printed tickets.

### Machu Picchu

Logistically there two time slots for getting in to Machu
Picchu. Either morning 6am-noon, or afternoon noon-6pm. Each slot has
a maximum of 2500 tickets per day. You may hear scary stories about
having to buy your ticket weeks in advance, but in the low season they
don't sell out. Tour operators and guides in particular will try to
scare you into buying a ticket from them in advance. It took us about
3 hours at our relaxed pace to see all of the regular parts of Machu
Picchu. We did not get up insanely early, we had time for breakfast at
the hotel and a calm stroll to the bus stop.

I do recommend starting by walking up to caretakers hut for the
view. It’s immediately to your left as you enter, and this is where
you get the classic “postcard” overview of the entire site. It
requires some steps but you can just take your time. After that, you
follow the suggested path through the site (look at the map as you
enter, note their route) and you’ll see everything. We did not hire a
guide and we’re just as happy that we didn’t. We could go at our own
pace, take the detours we wanted, and you can still hear guides
everywhere. Because a lot is still unknown about how Machu Picchu was
used most of what you’ll hear from the guides is authoritative
sounding speculation.

Machu Picchu seems like it was a big highly developed reserve for Inca
elites with a stunning amount of astonishingly high quality
stonework. The precision joinery is hard to believe. You definitely
get the feeling that this was a living city full of people going about
their lives. We overheard one person ask their guide “Why did the
Incas leave Machu Picchu?” “The Spanish came.” Indeed.

## Getting Back

It’s the same process but in reverse. Come down the mountain on the
bus, go to the Machu Picchu Pueblo train station, show your passport
and ticket, get on the train. Head back to Poroy. Catch a taxi from
Poroy to Cusco (Uber is pretty limited in Poroy.) People will tell you
to pre-book a car service or taxi but we didn’t find that to be
necessary. We took our time in the station, collected our luggage, and
were the last ones out long after everyone else had left and still we
had no trouble getting a taxi back to Cusco.

On our way back we knew we were booked on the “no free snacks” train,
so ate before we left. Rather than overpriced underwhelming train
station food, Debbie had noticed when we arrived that there were
people in the station eating real food from styrofoam containers. We
know from experience that means there are vendors nearby selling
pre-packaged hot meals. You just have to find them. In Machu Picchu
apparently they have to be somewhat discreet, so you look around for
people idling around big plastic bags and ask if they’re selling
food. We managed to get fried chicken, yucca chips, plantain, tomato,
cucumber and rice for s/. 10 (about US$3) each. I asked if I could
take a photo of the vendor and her bag but she said no.

## Bottom line

Machu Picchu is totally doable even for old out of shape people and
it’s worth it. The train ride is a lot of fun, the site itself is
beautiful and awe inspiring, and it’s not that complicated
logistically. If you come to Peru you really should go to Machu
Picchu. Just don’t forget to do all the other cool things too! (Like
eat food in Lima, and see condors in Colca Canyon.)
