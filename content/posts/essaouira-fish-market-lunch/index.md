Just had lunch at the Essaouira fish market. There's a bunch of little grills just off the main Fish Market where you can go and bring your fish or just sit and have lunch.

They bring you plates of fishes to eat. We had grilled sardines, shrimp and assorted fish.

On the side we had bread, frites, olives, chakchouka, limes and all for two-hundred dirhams per person. We are so stuffed!
